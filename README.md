## Guidance and improvements##

using master detail view aproach, however could use service factory to set up the model and retrieve model which is the json file. Could set up bower components load all the front end dependancies and gulp build up the pipeline to auto save and load. Additonally setting up karma to unit test if the router is working properly.
